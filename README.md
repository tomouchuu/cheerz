# CHEERZ

A react rebuild of the CHEERZ (https://cheerz.cz) website.

## Why?

It's been a very long time since I did a website rebuild and I found it immensely useful to learn how other developers make websites. The reason I picked CHEERZ is simply because I use it fairly often and wanted something that I could build a style guide out of as it's something I want to get into.

## Tech

Bootstraped with Create React App, styled-components for styling and using React-Styleguidist for the style guide.

### Components TODO
* Finish Homepage (Hero, Idols, Footer)
* Router
* Timeline Page (https://cheerz.cz/timeline)
* Search Page (https://cheerz.cz/search?keyword=ao)
* Unit Pages (https://cheerz.cz/unit/728)
* Idol Pages (https://cheerz.cz/artist/4940)
* Icons
* Ajax Calls (Timeline, Search, Etc.) (maybe graphql good to learn)
